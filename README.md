# HingeData
Creating an output using Hinge exported data

Hinge enables you to request and export your data from the app.

Using this export I have created a script to show basic outputs based on likes sent and received.

Please Note: Some code in this project was taken from Michael Johnson's "hinge_cleanup.py" code on GitHub, which is referenced below in lines 55-91
